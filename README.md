# Advection-aware autoencoders and long-short-term memory networks for reduced order modeling of parametric, advection-dominated PDEs

This is supporting code for our manuscript "Reduced order modeling using advection-aware autoencoders" by Sourav Dutta, Peter Rivera-Casillas, Brent Styles and Matthew Farthing, that is currently *under review*. The AA autoencoder model is tested with two different parametric variations of a linear advection problem.
